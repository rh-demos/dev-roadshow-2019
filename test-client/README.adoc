= Very simple implementation of the test client

This is a very simple poc implementation of a test client, which can generate load on a randomizer service and expose average response times for each service registered.

Features needed for a useful test client:
* Being able to scale test clients up and down with a consolidated view of measurements
* Dynamically changeable urls to measure. Even better use kubernetes service discovery to auto detect services to measure
* Dynamically configure the amount of work each client does.
