= Very simple implementation of a Randomizer

This is a very simple version of the randomizer, which is only useful to show the idea of what an implementation should look like.
There can only be one instance of the randomizer running. Furthermore the implementation will only be able to serve a limited number of concurrent requests. This is due to an oversimplified implementation of the caching mechanism (Singleton + LinkedList).
